This system is an Admin Interface for Managed Service Operations that integrates with Zabbix for network and server monitoring. It provides a robust web-based interface for managing various aspects of project-related monitoring, reporting, and file management, especially for users who are responsible for overseeing server health and availability across multiple projects.

System Overview
This platform uses Flask (Python) as the backend framework to serve dynamic content and handle requests from the frontend interface. It provides several key functionalities through integrated Python scripts and REST API calls to Zabbix, which is a well-known open-source monitoring software. The platform primarily interacts with two types of Zabbix servers: a regular Zabbix server and a dedicated Network Zabbix server, each serving different operational purposes.

Core Functions of the System
Project Creation and Verification:

This feature allows users to create a new project in the system. During the creation process, it verifies project details, such as the host group in the Zabbix server and, if applicable, the server tags and racks in the Network Zabbix server.
The system confirms the existence of specified host groups and server tags before proceeding to create project directories and store essential project information.
Graph Exporting for Zabbix Metrics:

Export Zabbix Graphs: This function enables exporting specific graphs (CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk space usage, etc.) for a project’s hosts from Zabbix.
Export Network Graphs: This feature exports network-specific graphs for a project, leveraging the Network Zabbix server.
The system allows users to specify the month and year for which the data should be exported, ensuring that relevant data is collected for reporting purposes.
Automated Report Generation:

The Generate Monthly Report feature compiles SLA data and performance metrics into a structured document. It uses the generate_report.py script to read through project and customer details, insert graphs, and apply formatting to create a polished report in .docx format.
The report includes Uptime SLAs, capacity trends, and essential statistics for each project’s servers, supporting resource planning and operational efficiency.
Combining Graph Export and Report Generation:

The Export and Generate Report option combines both exporting graphs and generating a monthly report in one action, automating the entire process for faster execution.
File Browser and Management:

The File Browser provides users with an interface to navigate through directories, view files, and download or delete them as needed. It includes options to view certain file types (e.g., images and text files) directly within the interface.
Users can search for specific files or projects, and results are filtered based on the search query, supporting efficient file organization and management.
Task Management and Status Tracking:

This feature leverages asynchronous task handling to manage background processes for graph export and report generation. Users are provided with real-time status updates for each task, ensuring they can monitor the progress and completion status of long-running processes.
Customer Details and SLA Downtime Calculation:

Customer details are stored in dedicated project folders, allowing easy access and review.
The system can calculate SLA Downtime by processing historical data for each server’s uptime, identifying gaps in monitoring data, and calculating uptime percentages to reflect the server's availability accurately.
Authentication and Integration with Zabbix:

The system authenticates with Zabbix’s API for each action that involves data retrieval or verification.
It performs host group checks, retrieves disk space items, and verifies host existence through Zabbix’s API, which allows for dynamic interaction with Zabbix without manual intervention.
Technical Details and Components
Frontend (HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap): The user interface uses HTML and Bootstrap for responsive design. JavaScript and jQuery provide interactive elements like collapsible forms, modal displays for image previews, and real-time status updates.

Backend (Flask, Python): The backend processes HTTP requests, manages task statuses, and serves dynamic content. It uses threading for handling asynchronous tasks and integrates various Python scripts to handle graph exporting, report generation, and SLA data processing.

Python Scripts:

generate_report.py: Collects SLA data, performance metrics, and generates .docx reports.
zabbix_graph_export.py: Exports graphs for selected metrics by interacting with the Zabbix API.
app.py: The main Flask application, responsible for routing, file management, and handling HTTP requests.
